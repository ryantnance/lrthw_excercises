    1. What are the three most essential skills that a beginner programmer needs to know?
        Reading and Writing

        Spotting Differences
    
    2. Please explain these three skills in your own words.
        Reading and Writing
          Being able to type, read and type what you read so you're not constantly going back and forth.
       
        Attention to Detail
          Making sure your typing and your code is perfect to avoid mistakes or bugs.
         
        Spotting Differences   
          When you do make a mistake in your code you must be able to find that mistake as quickly as possible.
         
    3. Why do you need to not copy and paste?
        So that you can practice writing and typing your code perfectly.
    
    4. Why is Practice and Persistence important?
        Practicing the right way will help you get better in anything you do.  It's difficult to learn this stuff so you 
        have to stick to it.  Eventually (hopefully), you'll look back on those struggles and understand that's what 
        helped you learn.
